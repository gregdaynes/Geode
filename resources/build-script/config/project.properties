# project.properties file defines overrides for default.properties

# Explanation: This file should be created by each user as and when he or she needs to override particular values.
# Consequently, it should not be placed under version control.


# Stylesheets
#
# Note: Stylesheets will be concatenated in the order they are listed in the file.stylesheets property (i.e. the last
# file listed will be at the end of the concatenated file), so it probably makes sense to have the main style.css file
# as the first entry
#
# NOTE: avoid adding spaces after the comma unless your file name has spaces (which you should probably consider not using anyway)
#
# Example:
# file.stylesheets  = style.css,lightbox.css,plugin.css
#
file.stylesheets  =

# LESS CSS Processing (http://lesscss.org)
#
# You must tell the script if you want to process your CSS as LESS
# build.css.less			= true
#
# You must also set your LESS css file as the root CSS file
#
# Example:
# file.root.stylesheet    = style.less

#
# You must tell the script if you want to process your CSS as SCSS

# Example:
# file.root.stylesheet    = style.scss

# Web Pages
#
# These are the pages (files) that will be served to users (.html, .php, .asp, etc). Files in this property will
# be minified / optimised and have any stylesheet or javascript references updated to the minified examples
#
# The paths need to be relative
#
# Files can be added in a comma separated form

# Excluded files and dirs
#
# Add any files or directories you add to the project and do not want to be copied to the publish directory as a
# comma separated list
# These files are ignored in addition to the default ones specified in default.properties.
# Example: file.exclude = badfolder/**
file.exclude      =

# Bypassed JavaScript files and dirs
#
# Add any files or folders within the js directory that you want to be copied to the publish directory as a
# comma separated list
# These files will not be concatenated or minimized and will simply be copied over as is.
# Note: you cannot declare an empty file.bypass property
# Example:
# file.js.bypass = widgets.js, gadgets.js, gidgets.js
# file.js.bypass =

# Closure Compiler Options

# By Default, it builds a production environment
# Set to dev if building a development environment
# Set to test if building a test environment

# Bypass Optimization for these image files or folders
#
# images.bypass
# If set, these images will not be optimized
# Note: you cannot declare an empty images.bypass property, it would exclude the entire img folder from being optimized
