## 3. How to Install

To get started adding _Geode_ to Hammer

  + Geode-0.1.0.zip -> Geode-0.1.0.hammer
3. Double click to install
4. Create new project in Hammer
  + Select Geode as template
5. Start coding








## 4. Ways to work with Geode

_Geode_ works as a standalone Hammer template, as well as works well with Grunt.





### The Hammer Way

To use _Geode_ with just Hammer
1. Create a new project using the Geode Template.

2. customize the variables in the variables.html file located in the partials directory
  + _Definitions of the variables are lower in this document._

3. Build with Hammer.





### Grunt & Hammer

to use _Geode_ with Grunt and Hammer together

_Prerequisits_
+ Node.js + NPM — nodejs.org
  + Easy install packages are found on the site.

1. Create a new project using the Geode Template.

2. Terminal - Navigate to the project folder. 
  + run: $npm install
    + this will install the required grunt packages & their dependencies

3. Customize the variables in the package.json file located in the root of the project.
  + _Definitions of the variables are lower in this document._

4. Terminal - Start up grunt
  + run: $grunt
    + Grunt will run and use the existing Build folder as its source.

5. Build with Hammer.

_As you edit the project, Hammer will build the files as normal, and Grunt will process the files as they build._





## 5. Variable Definitions

The following are the variables defined in _Geode_. They are found in two places. How you are working with _Geode_ will determine which variable file should be edited.

If you're working with just Hammer — you'll want to edit the _variables.html file found in the _partials directory.

If you're working with Hammer and Grunt — you'll want to edit the package.json file found in the root directory of _Geode_

## 7. Reusable Includes with Classes

NOTE: __Experimental__

_partials > elements > _nav.html demonstrates a simple way of using Hammer variables and classes to namespace a reusable Hammer Include.

the <nav> element was given a class with a defined Hammer Variable including a default.

Defining the $elementVariable immediately before adding the Hammer Include, will apply the variable to the element.

    <!-- @include nav -->
    - Builds as -
    <nav class="navigation-element"></nav>

    <!-- $elementNavigation classed-nav -->
    <!-- @include nav -->
    - Builds as -
    <nav class="classed-nav"></nav>
  
Any repeat include elements after the $elementVariable is defined, will continue to use $elementVariable until it is redefined again.
    
    <!-- $elementNavigation header-nav -->
    <!-- @include nav -->
    <!-- @include nav -->
    - Builds as -
    <nav class="header-nav"></nav>
    <nav class="header-nav"></nav>

    <!-- $elementNavigation header-nav -->
    <!-- @include nav -->

    <!-- $elementNavigation footer-nav -->
    <!-- @include nav -->
    - Builds as -
    <nav class="header-nav"></nav>

    <nav class="footer-nav"></nav>
