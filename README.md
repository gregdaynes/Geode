# html-template
===============

My initial starting point for front-end work

## How I Use This

1. check out this repo
2. add code folder to Hammer
3. work on the site
4. add code/Build to Anvil for viewing
5. debug
6. run build-script from resources folder
  + using "ant build"
7. add publish to Anvil
8. edit, debug, repeat 5-8
9. upload publish folder to server
10. sleep. You've earned it.
